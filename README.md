# Model-selections-Linear-and-general-linear-models

This repository explores a variety of different statistical models (multivariate linear, mixed effects, generalized linear) and applies them to a marine derived dataset. The aim is to accurately predict the concentraion of carbon exopolymers - substances crticial for both the efficient operation of desalination plants and the export of carbon from surface oceans. 

This compares and validates a series of models to determine the most suitable model for applicaiton.
